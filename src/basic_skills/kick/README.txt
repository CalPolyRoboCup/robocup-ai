The test file still has trouble moving around objects (other robots and the ball). Test works best when there is only one robot on the field that you are testing it on.

The robot with the kick_to action will however position itself in the correct position and angle to shoot the ball to the specified location on the field.

The move_to and ball_orbit functions I used in the test file may be out of date.
