Moves a robot to ballance passes between any number of points

The code is less reliable when more than two points are used. It is suggested to only use two points, but furthur functionalit exists.

Uses random sampling to reposition robots when they are too close to other robots with the same task, or it doesn't have many good shots.
This means consecutive runs will not be exactly the same.

This code's function is highly dependent on some magic numbers. I am sorry.
